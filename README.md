# IoT-based-Smart-Sanitizer-Opener-with-Person-Count-Authentication-using-NodeMCU
The spread of any diseases like recently we heard about CORONA virus is mostly spread in the crowded area like Railway Station, Airport , Bus Stand , Bank , Hotels , Schools,  Colleges etc. So to decrease the chance of spreading the germs through human intervention, or to maintain the hygiene among the people in crowded areas,  I made a “IoT based Smart Sanitizer Opener with Person Count Authentication using NodeMCU” that will check the person who would not use sanitizer and simultaneously send the SMS to the higher authority.
